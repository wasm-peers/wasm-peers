/*!
Library module for the one-to-many topology in client-server architecture.
There can be exactly one instance of [`MiniServer`] and arbitrary number of [`MiniClient`]'s
connected to the same session.

A [`RtcPeerConnection`] with an accompanying [`RtcDataChannel`] will be established between the [`MiniServer`]
and each of the [`MiniClient`]'s.
[`MiniServer`] can decide whether to send a message to a single peer,
identified by [`UserId`] returned by signaling server during connection establishment method,
with [`MiniServer::send_message`], or to fire to all clients with [`MiniServer::send_message_to_all`].

[`MiniClient`] only has an option to message the host with [`MiniClient::send_message_to_host`].

# Example

This example shows three peers connecting, with one being a dedicated host.
Host waits for both peers to connect and only then sends `ping` messages to both
and clients independently respond with `pong` messages.
