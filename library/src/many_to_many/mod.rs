/*!
Library module for implementation of the many-to-many topology of peer communication.

Each peer in session is an equal, with ability to send and receive messages from any other peer.
Unlike with one-to-many topology, any peer can leave at any time without compromising the network.

To identify peers you should store [`UserId`] accessible inside `on_open_callback` in some custom structure.
Then you can use it in [`NetworkManager::send_message`] to specify exactly which peer should receive the message.

# Example

In this example we create 3 peers that all establish connection with each other.
Each of the peers will send a `ping` message to each new connection.
Also each peer will respond with a `pong` response.
Overall we will expect 6 `ping` and 6 `pong` messages (3 connections, both peers in each).
